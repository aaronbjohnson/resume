### Project Description

This was my second project in the Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree. 
Here I developed an interactive resume application that would read resume
content from a JSON file and would dynamically display that content within a 
provided template. I made use of objects, functions, conditionals, and control 
structures to compose the content that would display on the resume.

Updates: I've re-designed the look and layout of the resume application and
have made use of Bootstrap's grid system.
